.. py:function:: initial_walker_states(initial_biases: str, vardict: dict[str, int], n_walkers: int, comment_char: str = '#') -> cupy.NDArray

   Generates initial conditions for an ensemble of walkers.

   :param initial_biases: Each line should be of the form

                          * NodeName,Bias

                          where NodeName is the name of the node, and Bias is the probability that the node
                          will be initialized to 1 (instead of 0). Nodes whose names are not listed are given
                          a bias of 0.5 by default.
   :type initial_biases: str
   :param vardict: A dictionary whose keys are the node names of the Boolean network and whose values
                   are the corresponding indicies describing the ordering of the variables.
   :type vardict: dict[str,int]
   :param n_walkers: The number of walkers to initialize.
   :type n_walkers: int
   :param comment_char: Empty lines and lines beginning with this character are ignored, by default '#'.
   :type comment_char: str, optional

   :returns: n_variables x n_walkers array of initial states.
   :rtype: cp.NDarray
